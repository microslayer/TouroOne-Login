# TouroOne Login Chrome Extension

The TouroOne system is an great aggregation of all Touro 
services into one online portal. However, it signs users 
out every half an hour
and it can be annoying to have to repeatedly sign in and 
re-navigate to Blackboard or other service. 

The TouroOne Login extension ameliorates this by automatically
signing the user in, as well providing the the ability 
to automatically redirect the user to any service. More details 
can be found in the link below. 

This extension is unaffiliated with Touro University and Blackboard.
